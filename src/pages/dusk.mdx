# Residence Evil III "Dusk"

_August 2025 / text by Mélanie Courtinat_

---

[Residence Evil](https://residenceevil.ch/) is an artistic residency program rooted in the exploration of internet horror.

Initially nested within the bunker of L'Abri in Geneva, the residency brings together digital and multidisciplinary artists to dive deep into the virtual abyss.

Its purpose is twofold: first, to explore contemporary fears native to the digital realm, fears that mutate alongside algorithms, interfaces, and networks; and second, to contribute to the emergence of a new digital folklore.

The third edition of Residence Evil, titled Dusk, took place in Paris. For five days, participants locked themselves away in a secret location, drawing inspiration from today's dusky atmosphere: politically unstable, socially anxious, and algorithmically distorted.

Through this immersive retreat, they confronted the spectral side of our hyperconnected world, transforming digital dread into new artistic narratives born from the twilight of the internet age.

Some explored works in progress, some did a lot of research and prototyping of experimental game design, and three projects got done despite the short time span of the event.

## Staggered (Nino Filiu)

Made inside of Unreal Engine, this 15mn art game is a playable poem about shock states and the death of the child self.

In the current context of global political crisis, Filiu chose to echo the feeling of impending doom with the teenage era of confusion between letting the child self die out and having real-life suicidal tendencies. As a direct metaphor of the Jungian's concepts of shadow, the core mechanic is having a anthracite-tinted doppelgagner constantly following us.

## How many pies can I bake until it's all over? (Circé Cherry Lac)

Made in Decker and taking the shape of a cooking point-and-click game, it turns the simple act of baking into a survival ritual, unfolding amid technological glitches, allegorical voices, and ruined landscapes left behind by previous generations. Actions such as picking fruit, pouring flour, or filling a crust become gestures of memory, grief, and transmission. At once playful and ominous, the piece probes how stories are told and rituals are carried forward at the threshold of collapse.

## L'Homme Vert (Florie Souday)

A short film and interactive video, L'Homme Vert watches over the forests of Gascony: master of birds, companion to insects and dragons, his body is bark, his eyes follow the free flight of wings.

Today, the sky fills with new creatures: drones, metals, circuits. We guide them as once l'Homme Vert did, but to what ends?

Between myth and technology, the sky has become a territory. What, then, do we make of our power over wings?
