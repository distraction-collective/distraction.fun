# Residence Evil III "Dusk"

Residence Evil is an artistic residency program rooted in the exploration of internet horror.
Initially nested within the bunker of L'Abri in Geneva, the residency brings together digital and multidisciplinary artists to dive deep into the virtual abyss.

Its purpose is twofold: first, to explore contemporary fears native to the digital realm, fears that mutate alongside algorithms, interfaces, and networks; and second, to contribute to the emergence of a new digital folklore.

The third edition of Residence Evil, titled Dusk, took place in Paris. For five days, participants locked themselves away in a secret location, drawing inspiration from today's dusky atmosphere: politically unstable, socially anxious, and algorithmically distorted.
Through this immersive retreat, they confronted the spectral side of our hyperconnected world, transforming digital dread into new artistic narratives born from the twilight of the internet age.
